Step 1: Download the raw forecasting data from the HFC forecasting tournament from:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/hfc. Focusing on RCTA, the first year of competition,
write a paragraph describing the structure of the three main raw data files.
Step 2: Take all individual forecasts, and aggregate the individual-level forecasts in the following
five ways. The result should be five data points for each question-day pair, using the most
recent forecast from each forecaster on that day (i.e. for each day that the question had any
forecasts, each of the following aggregates):
● Method 1: Raw Mean
● Method 2: Median
● Method 3: Geometric Mean
● Method 4: Trimmed Mean (trimming top and bottom 10% of forecasts)
● Method 5: Geometric Mean of odds, as described here:
